Mortgage Helper MVC

What Is Mortgage Heper?
At it's core, Mortgage Helper is a Web MVC Database hosted on Azure. It is designed to store properties that a user finds while searching for a new home. Mortgage Helper further provides the ability to store amentities associated with these properties, auto-generate a rating for each property created, and gives users the option to calculate mortgage rates based on properties that exist in the database.


Why Does It Exist?
This is a tool primarily designed for my personal use and the use of my friends. I and many people I know have an interest in purchasing rural properties, which comes with more difficulty than buying a new home in the suburbs or in the city. When purchasing a property farther away from civilization, there are more things to consider. The amenities and the ratings based off those amenities are designed to reflect that. The auto-generated ratings are designed to reflect the values that I am personally looking for when evaluating a property.


Where to start?

You have two options for how to use Mortgage Helper. 

1: If you would like to look thorugh the code and custumize any methods for your own preferences, you can download the code from github and run it on your local host. 

2: You can use the deployed version on Azure at https://mortgagehelperwebmvc.azurewebsites.net/


Whichever you choose - the first thing you want to do is click the link for the Into Guide on the home page after startup. That will walk you through how to use the site and clarify some aspects of the program.  


The Intro Guide is broken up into three sections:

	-Rural Properties, Urban Properties, and Mortgage Calculator. 

	-Rural properties is a step by step walkthrough for how to use the site if you are interesting in purchasing rural properties (which is what Mortgage Helper's primary functions are desgined for)

	-Urban Properties is the same for urban properties while also telling you which things you can ignore and what functionality is still applicable. 

	-Mortgage Calculator provides extra clarification for how to use the Calculate Mortgage feature that is associated with every property after it is created.
